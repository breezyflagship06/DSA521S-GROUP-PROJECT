# DSA521S-GROUP-PROJECT
This is our DSA group project. A Namibian music start-up is looking for an efficient music player algorithm for a mobile application .We were tasked  to come up with an algorithm, in the algorithm we implemented the following modules:
 a)Play module -in this module users can play the playlist in a sequential order from first to last. 
b) Play in Reverse module – in this module users can play the playlist from last song to the first song. 
c)Skip module – in this module users can skip to the next or previous song. 
d)Repeat module – Users should be able to repeat the module as many times. 
e)Add and Remove module- user can add and remove tracks from playlist as they wish.
Using our linear search algorithm users can also search for a specific song within the playlist.
