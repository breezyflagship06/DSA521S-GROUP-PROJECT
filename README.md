# DSA521S-GROUP-PROJECT
This is our our DSA group project.
A Namibian music start-up is looking for an efficient music player algorithm for a mobile applicatio, so we were tasked with coming up with this algorithm,
in the algorithm we implemented the following modules;
we added functionality to play tracks in both directions,
In addition, we added the functionality to allow for the playing of tracks on repeat,
user can add and remove tracks from playlist as they wish, using our linear search algorithm users can also search for a specific song within the  playlist.
